# LineFollowingRobotCSE204
This Arduino sketch implements the logic for a line-following robot using infrared sensors and obstacle avoidance with an ultrasonic sensor. The robot is controlled by two wheels, and its behavior is influenced by the feedback from the infrared sensors for line following and the ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection.
